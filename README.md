# Feedbacklops in Generative AI
#### two generators: 
#### 1. one generator creates an image from text, the other generator creates a caption to that image, and this caption becomes the prompt of the first generator, and repeat.. Or: 
#### 2. one generator creates a camption from an image, the other generator creates an image from that caption, and this image becomes the input of the first generator, and repeat.

Either way, we created a loop that we can run for 5, 10, 1000 steps or how many you want. 

We used stableDiffusio_v1.4 and BLIP and stableDiffusio_v1.4 and microsoft GIT, but the models can be changed any time. 
The output is very dependent on the first input, while image input has a clearer impact than text-prompts.
